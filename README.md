## INTRODUCTION
This week we are building a bookmark manager.
Below are the user stories

## USER STORIES

```
As browser users
So that we can see our favourite pages
We want it to show a list of links on the homepage

As browser users
So we can find the links quickly
We want to see the links in descending chronological order

As browser users
So that we can save our favourite pages
We want to be able to add the site's address and title

As browser users
So that we know what the links are
We want to be able to add tags to links

As browser users
So we can find what we are looking for
We want to be able to filter links by a tag
```
